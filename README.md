# Systemmonitoring-and-powerconsumption
what is this project about?
It is a cross-platform program which works both on macbook and windows . Our project mainly focused on contributing following factors like charge percent, plugged or unplugged, cpu usage, ram usage,ram in GB and system specifications etc . It is easy to understand, flexible as we have created an interface with Tkinter .

we developed this project by Python and interface using tkinter , using python libraries like psutil,pprint,os,platform. 

In order to run the code effeciently in your PC , please download Tkinter , Psutil in your PC prior 

Note :- the interface differs in appearance in both mac and windows , so try to change the tkinter's bg or fg color , to make it look good
